## Application Content
In this application, Qlik Sense has three different visualization approaches; Generate Insights-Insight advisor, Fields First-Chart suggestion assistance and Charts First-No assistance were used. There are three separate sheets named My insights, My suggestions and My customer charts. 
### 1. Sheet: My insights
In the first sheet, there are three separate charts created using insight advisor for analysis. In the first chart, an interactive world map is used showing the countries ordered and the total sales to these countries. In the second chart, the Bar Chart showing the total unit price according to the product is used. In the third chart, 'Which country has the highest quantity?' using the 'Ask us a question' field. The question was asked and the Bar Chart was used, which shows the total amount in decreasing order according to the countries.
### 2. Sheet: My suggestions
The second sheet has two separate charts created using Chart Suggestions for analysis. In the first chart, Country field is added to the KPI chart showing the total sales amount, and a world map chart is used that relates the color values to the sum of the sales values in the country. In the second chart, Line Chart is used, which shows the change in sales according to year-month dates.
### 3. Sheet: My custom charts
In the third sheet, Bar chart, Table, Pie Chart, KPI, Filter pane, and Text & image graphics are used. Bar chart shows sales totals per product category, Table shows product information and sales amount, KPI chart shows total sales amount, Pie chart shows sales for new vs. existing accounts. By setting the dimension of the filter pane to year, the results are displayed in the graphs created according to the selected year. This sheet was developed without assistance.
## Analyze a sheet
Two separate analyzes were made using the visualizations created on the third sheet and these were saved as bookmarks. In the bookmark named "New accounts, swimwear, 2017", swimwear sales made by opening a new account in 2017 are analyzed. In the bookmark named "2017 orders", the sales information of 2014 is analyzed.
Two separate analyzes were made using the visualizations created on the third sheet and these were saved as snapshot. In the pie chart, the year 2013 was first selected and its snapshot was taken. Then, the year 2015 was selected and its snapshot was taken.
## Create a story
In the first slide, sales of new and existing accounts in 2013 and 2015 are compared using snapshots.
In the secont slide, By using the page named My Suggestions, the desired regions or countries are selected from the interactive map and the sales amount according to the years are displayed on the line chart.
